It is a simple measure that keeps a cumulative total volume by adding or subtracting each period's volume, depending on the price movement. This measure expands on the basic volume measure by combining volume and price movement. The idea behind this indicator is that volume precedes price movement, so if a security is seeing an increasing OBV, it is a signal that volume is increasing on upward price moves. Decreases mean that the security is seeing increasing volume on down days.\n",
